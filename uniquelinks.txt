To generate unique links:

1. Have the server-side generate a random number.
2. Have the server call the database and check to see if the number has already been taken using binary search. -- O(log n)
    If taken, generate new random number (do-while loop).
    If not taken, proceed.
3. Encode that number in base 64 (other bases are also OK):
    0-9, Capital Letters, Lowercase Letters, -, _
4. Give the number in base 64 as the link.
5. Insert the new number into the list of "taken" numbers so that they remain in ascending order. -- O(n)

Justification:
This system is broadly based on YouTube's link generation system. Developing a "counting" methodology
is not feasible for if multiple people want to create links at the same time. Random generation solves
this issue. "Counting" or developing an algorithm for unique generation also poses a massive security
and privacy risk. Users who know the algorithm may be able to view calendars they are not supposed to,
or at least know of their existence.
